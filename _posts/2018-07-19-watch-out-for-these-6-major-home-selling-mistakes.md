Many important steps are involved in selling a home, which means there are a number of opportunities for things to go wrong. Today I would like to highlight the six biggest mistakes someone can make when selling their home.

**1. Picking the wrong agent.** The right agent needs to be available when you need them. Getting in touch with them should not be a hassle. The right agent will also be honest and straightforward, even when they disagree with you. Their job is to be objective and to lead you in the right decision.

**2. Overpricing your home.** Even in a good market, overpriced homes will not budge. It is important to base your list price on comparable recent sales.

**3. Failing to do simple repairs.** If your dog has chewed at the banisters or scratched up the door, sand and paint them so that they look their best. While this is just one example, in general, it is important to fix up your home.

**4. Neglecting to declutter your home.** Buyers want to be able to imagine themselves in their home. It is important to clear your home of personal items or anything taking up excessive space. If necessary, consider renting a storage unit to store some of your belongings.

**5. Not allowing adequate access to your home.** Buyers who are ready, willing, and able to purchase a property will want to see your home as soon as possible. So, make sure that your agent has a lockbox ready and that you clearly specify when you are available.

**6. Being emotional about your home.** Once you put your house on the market, you must think of it as a property, not a home. If you get a lowball offer, do not get offended. Simply have your agent write a counteroffer. You have to be strategic, not emotional. Also, do not be hurt if you hear buyers talking about remodeling.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
