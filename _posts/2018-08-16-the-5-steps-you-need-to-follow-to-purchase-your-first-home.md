Here are the five steps you need to take in order to purchase your first home.

First, **have good credit.** You need good credit in order to obtain a good interest rate. If you’re vigilant about your credit, it will pay off for you. There are several loan programs you can qualify for with a credit score as low as 580, and you can qualify for conventional and FHA loans with a score of 620 or above.

Second, **get pre-approved.** When you meet with a lender to get pre-approved, you’ll need two years’ worth of tax returns, two months’ worth of bank statements, one month of paycheck stubs, and a copy of your driver’s license and security card.

Third, **make sure you’ve been employed in the same line of work for the last two years.** For instance, if you work in retail and you decide to switch companies, that’s fine just as long as you stay in the same line of work and you’ve been at your new job for at least a month.

Fourth, **choose the right buyer’s agent.** You need an agent by your side who will be accessible, and you need to let them know when you’ll be available to meet with them. It’s always best to be specific about which time slots you’re available for. You want to be flexible enough so that every time you and your agent go out and look at homes, you have a least three hours to do so. In that time frame, you should look at no more than four to five homes—after that, they all start looking the same.

Finally, **be prepared to pay your down payment and closing costs.** If you’re financing with an FHA loan, you’ll only need to put down 3%. If you’re doing a conventional loan and you have good credit, there are programs that allow you to put down as little as 3% to 5%.

You should save 3% of the overall purchase price to cover your closing costs, which include your lender fees and your title and escrow fees. If you don’t have the money to cover your closing costs, let your agent know so they can ask the seller to give you a 3% credit back. There are many different ways this can be done. For example, the seller can increase the price by 3%.

In any case, good communication is key, so make sure you’re honest and upfront with your agent and don’t keep any secrets regarding your credit, qualification, and available funds.
