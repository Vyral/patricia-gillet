Unfortunately, real estate deals don’t always make it to closing—but what causes transactions to fall through? There are a few different reasons this can happen, and we’ll go over three examples today.<br> 

**1. An extensive repair list.** If the inspection results in a long list of necessary repairs, your agent may need to negotiate on your behalf in order to devise a fair arrangement with the seller. Otherwise, requesting numerous repairs could cause your deal to fall apart. And without clearance, your loan will be unable to close.<br> 

**2. A low appraisal.** If a property is listed at $250,000 but the appraisal comes in at $200,000, this can cause major issues. Unless the buyer and seller can renegotiate and come to an agreement on how to resolve this problem. On top of this, FHA appraisals will remain with the property for six months, which could impact future offers if the original deal falls through.<br>

**3. Unpleasant surprises during the walkthrough.** When the seller moves out, they may remove fixtures from the home that you had expected to be included in your purchase. However, sellers are entirely within their right to do this unless the purchase contract stipulated that you were to receive those items. To avoid unpleasant surprises on moving day, always go on a final walk through before signing any closing documents.
