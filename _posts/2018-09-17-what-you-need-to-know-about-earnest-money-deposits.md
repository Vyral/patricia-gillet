What is an earnest money deposit and why is it important to a real estate transaction?

**An earnest money deposit is a sum of money you deposit to show good faith to the seller that you’re genuinely interested in buying their property.** Whether you put down 1% or 2% depends on the state you live in. However much you put down is held in escrow to either bring down the balance of your loan or be put toward your closing costs.

It’s important to make sure that your Realtor sets the terms of your earnest money deposit in the purchase contract. If the contract gets canceled, who gets that money back? Will you have to pay a fee to the title company? Make sure your money is protected. If the contract is canceled through no fault of your own, you should get that money back.
